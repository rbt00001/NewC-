Learning C++

# Learning

In this folder and the following to come, I will be learning C++.
While it is a legacy program I feel it is important to learn and
will be following up with very simple programs in this repository
and create more complex programs over time.

# Goal

The goal of this and the subsequent files is to create a program that
can be used for simply automation of controls. I would like to be a
system controls and automation specialist for HVAC applications.

This ReadME will be used across various repositories until the projects get more complicated.
